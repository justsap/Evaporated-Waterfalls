--------------------------------------

Information: 
    This datapack changes the generation of water springs to spawn way less often at higher y-levels, and more often at lower y-levels. This also caps waterfalls to only generate below 
y-level 160. And to match, lava streams (aka lavafalls), have also been reduced in general. 

This reduces the likelyhood of waterfalls & lava streams flooding areas and ruin good-looking terrain. As well as reducing the amount of lava streams that lead to forest fires.
